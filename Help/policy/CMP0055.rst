CMP0055
-------

Strict checking for the :command:`break` command.

CMake 3.1 and lower allowed calls to the :command:`break` command
outside of a loop context and also ignored any given arguments.
This was undefined behavior.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow :command:`break` to be placed
outside of loop contexts and ignores any arguments.  The NEW behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if a misplaced break or any arguments are found.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.2.
CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses
OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or
NEW explicitly.

CMP0042
-------

No compiler feature test for GenerateExportHeader.

In CMake 2.8.12, the GenerateExportHeader module ran feature tests to determine
the content to generate in export, import and deprecation macros, and the flag
to pass to the compiler.

The OLD behavior for this policy is to run the compiler feature tests to determine
macro content and compiler flags. The NEW behavior for this policy is to rely on the
:prop_tgt:`CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET` and :prop_tgt:`VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN` target
properties.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.0.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.
